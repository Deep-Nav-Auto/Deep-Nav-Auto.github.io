[Dr. Hongzhou Yang](https://profiles.ucalgary.ca/hongzhou-yang) is an Assistant Professor at the University of Calgary, leading the Intelligent Navigation and Mapping Lab. Dr. Hongzhou Yang has over ten years academic and industrial experience regarding navigation and mapping by integrating multiple sensors with various estimation/optimization methods. He obtained Ph.D. in Geomatics Engineering from University of Calgary after proposing and developing a novel real-time precise point positioning (PPP) system in 2018. Passionate about autonomous driving, he worked at the Level 4 autonomous trucking company TuSimple and was responsible for the pose estimation and high-definition map generation. Prior to that, he worked at Profound Positioning Inc. for over four years, researching and developing Level 2 navigation products with low-cost GNSS/IMU/Odometer sensors. His research interests include sensor fusion, localization and mapping, estimation theory, machine learning for navigation, navigation in challenging environment, intelligent traffic system, robotics, and computer vision in pose estimation. He is aiming to explore the power of sensor fusion and machine learning in localization and mapping to improve the accuracy, safety, and reliability of autonomous driving.
