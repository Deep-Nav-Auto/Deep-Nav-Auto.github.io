We are excited to welcome our 2025 summer research students to the Intelligent Navigation and Mapping Lab. This summer, ten students have joined us to contribute to projects in smartphone navigation, SLAM, IMU stochastic modeling, ML based fall detection,  diffusion and Gaussian Splatting, and end-to-end self-driving. Roy, Chan, Carter, Dennis, Raymond, Trevor, Kartik, and Sahat are supported through programs such as the NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award, Mitacs, the Schulich School of Engineering, and other internal initiatives. We are also joined by two enthusiastic high school researchers—Jerry and Stephanie—who are gaining early research exposure through hands-on work with our team. We look forward to an exciting and productive summer!
