We are excited to share that Louise, Favour, and Rebekah have already joined our research group this summer. Louise is visiting us from Hong Kong PolyU, courtesy of the UG Summer Research Abroad Sponsorship (USRA), while Favour and Rebekah have joined thanks to funding from the Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) project. Additionally, earlier this summer, three more research students—Raymond, Bosco, and Trevor—joined our group. Raymond and Bosco are recipients of the NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award, and Trevor is funded through SSE.
