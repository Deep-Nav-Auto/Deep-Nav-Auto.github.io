Year-end Group Dinner at Happy Lamb Hot Pot! We had a wonderful afternoon celebrating the achievements of the year with great food and even better company. This year, we were joined by new faces: Ananya (not in the picture due to travelling), Paul, Shichuang, and Daiwuran, who have brought fresh perspectives and energy to the group. A special shout-out to Shuai, who was the MVP of the buffet today! Here's to a productive and exciting new year ahead.
